## About Me:

I enjoy Sports and Music, that's why I play the Guitar and go to the Gym.
I started Programming in Java when I was about 12 Years old and still enjoy the Problem Solving Part of Programming. 
I use Neovim as my Code Editor of Choice, because it's fast and customizable, it also gives you the Vim Keybinds, which I like.
